# TELOS about Jeff

> Inspired by [Daniel Miessler](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Telos) and
> [Network Chuck](https://github.com/theNetworkChuck/telos).

## ✅ Problems

- **P1:** Unemployment in software development for older, undereducated individuals
- **P2:** Lack of awareness and control over digital footprint and privacy
- **P3:** The dangerous blend of "dumb", "confident", and "proud" in human behavior

## 🎯 Missions

- **M1 (->P1):** Empower the next generation with valuable knowledge to prevent unemployment and foster economic
  independence.
- **M2 (->P2):** Model and advocate for conscious digital exposure to protect personal freedom in a hyperconnected
  world.
- **M3 (->P3):** Mentor self-awareness and humility through interdisciplinary practices like jiu-jitsu to counter
  ego-driven behavior.

## 🎙️ Narratives

- **Short (15 words):** "Empowering minds, guarding freedom, and mentoring humility for a more conscious generation."
- **Conversational (1 sentence):** "I'm working to prepare the next generation for real freedom-mental, digital, and
  emotional-starting with what I live and teach."
- **30-sec Pitch:** "I've faced barriers in tech, I question how our data is silently harvested, and I see how pride
  distorts human behavior. That's why I'm committed to spreading meaningful knowledge, protecting digital freedom by
  example, and mentoring self-awareness and humility through practices like jiu-jitsu. It's just one life-but I want it
  to echo where it matters."
