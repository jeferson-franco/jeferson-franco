# Project Brief: TELOS about Jeff

## Overview

"TELOS about Jeff" is a personal initiative inspired by Daniel Miessler and Network Chuck's Telos projects. It aims to
address critical societal and personal challenges through targeted missions and goals. This document serves as the
foundation for the project, defining its core requirements and objectives.

## Problems Addressed

- **P1:** Unemployment in software development for older, undereducated individuals.
- **P2:** Lack of awareness and control over digital footprint and privacy.
- **P3:** The dangerous blend of "dumb", "confident", and "proud" in human behavior.

## Missions

- **M1 (->P1):** Empower the next generation with valuable knowledge to prevent unemployment and foster economic
  independence.
- **M2 (->P2):** Model and advocate for conscious digital exposure to protect personal freedom in a hyperconnected
  world.
- **M3 (->P3):** Mentor self-awareness and humility through interdisciplinary practices like jiu-jitsu to counter
  ego-driven behavior.

## Goals

- **G1 (->M1):** Complete a full-stack web development portfolio by December 2025 and publish it online.
  - _Metric:_ Portfolio fully built and accessible.
- **G2 (->M2):** Complete a privacy audit of all personal devices quarterly and document the findings and improvements.
  - _Metric:_ Four audits completed and documented by December 2025.
- **G3 (->M3):** Develop a personal curriculum linking jiu-jitsu principles with emotional intelligence by October 2025.

## Projects

- **PJT2 (->G2):** Maintain and follow a quarterly digital hygiene checklist for device audits.

## Challenges

- **C1:** Motivation dips.
- **C2:** Limited time.
- **C3:** Lack of resources.

## Strategies

- **S1 (->C1):** Maintain energy and focus by waking early, exercising, drinking coffee, and staying mentally aware.
- **S2 (->C2):** Apply the mindset "non ducor, duco" - lead your time instead of being led by it.
- **S3 (->C3):** Maximize what you have—squeeze the juice out of every orange before seeking more.

## Narratives

- **Short (15 words):** "Empowering minds, guarding freedom, and mentoring humility for a more conscious generation."
- **Conversational (1 sentence):** "I'm working to prepare the next generation for real freedom—mental, digital, and
  emotional—starting with what I live and teach."
- **30-sec Pitch:** "I've faced barriers in tech, I question how our data is silently harvested, and I see how pride
  distorts human behavior. That's why I'm committed to spreading meaningful knowledge, protecting digital freedom by
  example, and mentoring self-awareness and humility through practices like jiu-jitsu. It's just one life—but I want it
  to echo where it matters."
