# Product Context: TELOS about Jeff

## Purpose

"TELOS about Jeff" exists to address critical societal and personal challenges by empowering individuals with knowledge,
protecting their digital freedom, and fostering self-awareness and humility. This document outlines the motivations
behind the project and the problems it aims to solve, focusing on the user experience goals for each mission.

## Problems Solved

- **P1: Unemployment in Software Development for Older, Undereducated Individuals**
  - Many older or undereducated individuals face barriers to entry in the tech industry, leading to unemployment or
    underemployment. This project seeks to bridge that gap by providing accessible knowledge and skills.
- **P2: Lack of Awareness and Control Over Digital Footprint and Privacy**
  - In a hyperconnected world, individuals often unknowingly compromise their privacy through digital exposure. This
    initiative aims to educate and model conscious digital behavior to safeguard personal freedom.
- **P3: The Dangerous Blend of "Dumb", "Confident", and "Proud" in Human Behavior**
  - Ego-driven behavior, characterized by a lack of self-awareness combined with overconfidence, can lead to harmful
    decisions. This project addresses this by promoting humility and introspection.

## User Experience Goals

  - **Target Users**: Aspiring developers, particularly older or undereducated individuals seeking to enter the tech
    field.

    development portfolio) that users can follow to gain employable skills. The experience should be encouraging, with
    step-by-step guidance to build confidence and economic independence.
- **For Mission 2 (M2 -> P2): Protecting Digital Freedom**
  - **Target Users**: Individuals concerned about privacy or unaware of digital risks.
  - **Experience Goal**: Offer actionable insights and tools (such as quarterly privacy audits) to help users understand
    and control their digital footprint. The experience should be eye-opening, empowering users to make informed choices
    about their online presence.
- **For Mission 3 (M3 -> P3): Mentoring Self-Awareness and Humility**
  - **Target Users**: Individuals open to personal growth, including those interested in interdisciplinary practices
    like jiu-jitsu.
  - **Experience Goal**: Create a curriculum that connects physical practices with emotional intelligence, fostering a
    mindset of humility and self-reflection. The experience should be transformative, encouraging users to challenge
    ego-driven behaviors through structured learning.
