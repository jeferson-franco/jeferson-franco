# Active Context: TELOS about Jeff

## Current Work Focus

As of the initialization of the memory bank on June 30, 2025, the primary focus for "TELOS about Jeff" is setting up the
foundational documentation and planning for the key projects outlined in the project brief. The current work includes:

- Establishing the memory bank structure to ensure persistent knowledge across sessions.
- Planning the initial steps for the following projects:
  - **PJT1: Full-Stack Web Development Portfolio** - Identifying the scope and technologies for building a portfolio by
    December 2025.
  - **PJT2: Quarterly Digital Hygiene Checklist** - Outlining a process for conducting privacy audits on personal
    devices.
  - **PJT3: Personal Curriculum for Jiu-Jitsu and Emotional Intelligence** - Defining the structure and content for the
    curriculum to be completed by October 2025.

## Recent Changes

- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Core files such as `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` have been created to
  document the project's scope, motivations, and user experience goals.
- No technical implementations or project-specific changes have been made yet, as the focus is on setting up the
  documentation framework.

## Next Steps

- Complete the initialization of the remaining core memory bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and
  `progress.md`) to fully establish the knowledge base.
- Begin detailed planning for PJT1 (Full-Stack Portfolio), including selecting specific technologies and frameworks.
- Draft an initial checklist for PJT2 (Digital Hygiene) to guide quarterly privacy audits.
- Outline the key sections for PJT3 (Curriculum) to connect jiu-jitsu principles with emotional intelligence.
- Update this file with any new decisions, considerations, or progress on the above tasks.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Technology Selection for Portfolio (PJT1)**: Deciding on the stack for the full-stack portfolio (e.g., React for
  frontend, Node.js for backend) based on ease of learning and industry relevance for aspiring developers.
- **Format for Privacy Audits (PJT2)**: Considering whether to use a simple checklist or a more detailed template for
  documenting findings and improvements during audits.
- **Delivery Method for Curriculum (PJT3)**: Exploring options for how the curriculum will be shared (e.g., PDF
  document, online course platform, or personal blog).

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- **User-Centric Approach**: All projects should prioritize accessibility and clarity to ensure they are useful for the
  target audience (aspiring developers, privacy-conscious individuals, and those seeking personal growth).
- **Iterative Development**: Start with minimal viable products for each project and iterate based on feedback or
  personal reflection.
- **Documentation First**: Maintain detailed documentation in the memory bank before and after each significant step to
  preserve context and rationale.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Initial setup of the memory bank has highlighted the importance of clear structure in documentation to avoid confusion
  as the project grows.
- The broad scope of missions (from tech education to personal growth) requires careful prioritization to manage limited
  time and resources effectively.

This file will be updated regularly to reflect the current state of work, decisions, and insights for "TELOS about
Jeff", ensuring continuity and focus across sessions.
