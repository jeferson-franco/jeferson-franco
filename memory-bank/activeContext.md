# Active Context

This file captures the current focus of work, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions for the project.

## Current Work Focus

- Developing a Python script to scrape the latest cartoon from Explosm.net and integrating it into the project's
  documentation.

## Recent Changes

- Created and executed `scripts/scrape_explosm.py` to download the latest Explosm cartoon and save it as
  `latest_explosm_cartoon.jpg`.
- Updated `README.md` to display the latest cartoon with a humorous caption: "Warning: May cause unexpected bursts of
  laughter or existential dreadâ€”Cyanide & Happiness style!"

## Next Steps

- Monitor the script's performance over time to ensure it adapts to potential changes in the Explosm.net website
  structure.
- Consider automating the script execution periodically to keep the cartoon updated in the README.md.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- The script uses fallback logic to handle dynamic website structures, ensuring robustness in scraping tasks.
- The image is saved with a static filename to maintain consistency in the README.md embedding.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Use of `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping tasks due to their simplicity and effectiveness.
- Emphasis on clear documentation and presentation in README.md to enhance project visibility.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Implementing robust fallback mechanisms is crucial for web scraping to handle unexpected changes in website HTML
  structure.
- Adding engaging content like humorous captions can improve the user experience in project documentation.
