Date: 2025-07-01 TaskRef: "Create script to scrape latest Explosm cartoon and update README.md"

Learnings:

- Successfully created a Python script to scrape the latest cartoon from Explosm.net using `requests` and
  `BeautifulSoup`.
- Learned to handle dynamic website structures by implementing fallback logic to identify the latest comic image URL
  through keyword and date pattern matching.
- Integrated the scraped image into the `README.md` file with a humorous caption for enhanced presentation.

Difficulties:

- Initial uncertainty about the exact structure of the Explosm.net website required implementing robust fallback
  mechanisms to ensure the script could adapt to changes in HTML structure.

Successes:

- The script executed successfully, downloading and saving the latest cartoon as `latest_explosm_cartoon.jpg`.
- The `README.md` was updated to display the cartoon with a fitting caption, enhancing the project's documentation.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: Implement robust fallback logic for web scraping tasks to handle dynamic website changes.
- Project-specific: Document the scraping script's functionality and usage in the memory bank for future reference.
