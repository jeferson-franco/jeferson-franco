# System Patterns: TELOS about Jeff

## System Architecture Overview

"TELOS about Jeff" encompasses multiple projects with distinct technical requirements. As of the initialization of the
memory bank on June 30, 2025, the primary focus is on planning the architecture for the full-stack web development
portfolio (PJT1), which is a key component of Goal 1 (G1). Other projects, such as the digital hygiene checklist (PJT2)
and personal curriculum (PJT3), do not yet have defined technical architectures but will be addressed as they progress.
This document outlines the proposed system patterns and technical decisions for PJT1, with placeholders for future
projects.

### Full-Stack Web Development Portfolio (PJT1)

The full-stack web development portfolio aims to showcase skills and projects to potential employers or clients,
targeting aspiring developers, particularly older or undereducated individuals. The architecture is designed to be
simple, scalable, and easy to maintain, reflecting best practices in web development.

#### Proposed Architecture

- **Frontend**:
  - Framework: React.js
  - Rationale: React is widely used, has a large community for support, and offers a component-based structure that
    simplifies UI development for beginners. It also aligns with industry demand, making it a valuable skill for the
    target audience.
  - Key Features: Responsive design using CSS frameworks like Material-UI or Bootstrap, single-page application (SPA)
    for smooth navigation, and state management with Redux or Context API for portfolio data.
- **Backend**:
  - Framework: Node.js with Express.js
  - Rationale: Node.js paired with Express provides a lightweight, JavaScript-based backend solution, allowing
    developers to use the same language across the stack, which reduces the learning curve. It's suitable for creating
    RESTful APIs to manage portfolio content.
  - Key Features: REST API endpoints for managing projects, user authentication (if a login feature is included), and
    integration with a database for dynamic content.
- **Database**:
  - Type: MongoDB (NoSQL)
  - Rationale: MongoDB offers flexibility in data modeling, which is useful for a portfolio that may evolve with
    different types of content (e.g., projects, blog posts). It also pairs well with Node.js through libraries like
    Mongoose, simplifying development for beginners.
  - Key Features: Collections for projects, user profiles (if applicable), and metadata for easy content management.
- **Deployment**:
  - Platform: Vercel or Netlify for frontend, Heroku or AWS for backend
  - Rationale: These platforms offer free tiers and easy deployment processes, which are ideal for learning and
    showcasing projects without significant cost. They also provide CI/CD integration for automated updates.
  - Key Features: Static hosting for frontend, serverless or containerized backend deployment, and custom domain support
    for a professional appearance.

#### Component Relationships

- The frontend (React) will communicate with the backend (Express) via REST API calls to fetch and update portfolio
  data.
- The backend will interact with the MongoDB database to store and retrieve content dynamically.
- User interactions on the frontend (e.g., viewing projects, submitting contact forms) will trigger API requests to the
  backend, which processes the data and responds accordingly.
- Deployment platforms will handle the hosting of both frontend and backend, ensuring accessibility via the web.

#### Critical Implementation Paths

- **Setup Phase**: Initialize the project with Create React App for the frontend and a basic Express server for the
  backend. Connect to MongoDB using environment variables for security.
- **Development Phase**: Build core portfolio features (e.g., project listing, about page) on the frontend, and
  corresponding API endpoints on the backend. Implement basic CRUD operations for project data.
- **Testing Phase**: Add unit tests for backend APIs using Jest, and component tests for frontend using React Testing
  Library. Ensure responsiveness across devices.
- **Deployment Phase**: Deploy the frontend to Vercel/Netlify and backend to Heroku/AWS. Configure DNS for a custom
  domain if desired.

## Key Technical Decisions

- **JavaScript Ecosystem**: Choosing JavaScript (React, Node.js) as the primary language across the stack to minimize
  learning complexity for aspiring developers. This also leverages a vast ecosystem of libraries and tutorials.
- **NoSQL over SQL**: Opting for MongoDB over traditional SQL databases due to its flexibility with unstructured data,
  which suits a portfolio that may include varied content types.
- **Cloud Hosting**: Prioritizing managed hosting services (Vercel, Heroku) over self-hosted solutions to reduce
  infrastructure management overhead, allowing focus on development skills.
- **Open-Source Tools**: Using free, open-source tools and frameworks to ensure accessibility for individuals with
  limited resources, aligning with the project's mission to empower undereducated individuals.

## Design Patterns in Use

- **MVC Pattern (Model-View-Controller)**: Applied loosely with React components as views, Express routes/controllers
  for logic, and MongoDB for models. This separation aids in organizing code for beginners.
- **RESTful API Design**: Backend APIs will follow REST principles for intuitive endpoint structure (e.g., GET
  /projects, POST /projects), making integration straightforward.
- **Component-Based Design**: Frontend will use React's component model to create reusable UI elements (e.g.,
  ProjectCard, Navbar), promoting modularity and maintainability.

## Future Projects (Placeholders)

- **Quarterly Digital Hygiene Checklist (PJT2)**:
  - Architecture: Likely a non-technical or lightweight technical solution (e.g., a documented process in a spreadsheet
    or simple app).
  - Patterns: To be determined as the project scope is defined.
- **Personal Curriculum for Jiu-Jitsu and Emotional Intelligence (PJT3)**:
  - Architecture: Potentially a static website, PDF document, or content management system.
  - Patterns: To be determined based on delivery method (e.g., online course vs. downloadable resource).

This document will be updated as technical decisions are finalized and as additional projects under "TELOS about Jeff"
progress. It serves as a guide for system architecture and design patterns to ensure consistency and scalability.
