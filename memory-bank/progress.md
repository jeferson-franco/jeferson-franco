# Progress: TELOS about Jeff

## Current Status

As of the initialization of the memory bank on June 30, 2025, "TELOS about Jeff" is in the early planning and setup
phase. The focus has been on establishing the foundational documentation within the memory bank to ensure persistent
knowledge and context across sessions. No technical implementations or project-specific milestones have been achieved
yet, as the priority is to create a solid base for future work.

## What Works

- **Memory Bank Setup**: Core documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`,
  `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`) have been successfully created, providing a structured knowledge base for
  the project.
- **Project Vision**: The overarching goals, missions, and problems to be addressed are clearly defined, aligning all
  future efforts with the project's purpose of empowering individuals, protecting digital freedom, and fostering
  self-awareness.

## What's Left to Build

- **Full-Stack Web Development Portfolio (PJT1)**:
  - **Status**: Not started.
  - **Next Milestones**: Select specific technologies and frameworks, set up the development environment, and create a
    minimal viable portfolio page by Q3 2025.
  - **End Goal**: Complete and publish the portfolio online by December 2025.
- **Quarterly Digital Hygiene Checklist (PJT2)**:
  - **Status**: Not started.
  - **Next Milestones**: Draft an initial checklist for privacy audits, conduct the first audit, and document findings
    by the end of Q3 2025.
  - **End Goal**: Maintain and follow the checklist quarterly, with four audits documented by December 2025.
- **Personal Curriculum for Jiu-Jitsu and Emotional Intelligence (PJT3)**:
  - **Status**: Not started.
  - **Next Milestones**: Outline the curriculum structure and draft initial content by Q3 2025.
  - **End Goal**: Complete and share the curriculum by October 2025.
- **General Documentation**: Continue updating memory bank files with progress, decisions, and learnings as projects
  advance.

## Known Issues

- **Time Constraints**: Limited personal time may slow progress on the ambitious goals set for 2025. Prioritization and
  efficient time management strategies (e.g., "non ducor, duco") will be critical.
- **Motivation Dips**: Potential fluctuations in motivation could impact consistency. Strategies like early waking and
  exercise are planned to maintain focus.
- **Resource Limitations**: Lack of access to premium tools or services may require reliance on free or open-source
  alternatives, which could limit certain features or scalability. The focus will be on maximizing available resources.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Focus on Documentation**: The decision to prioritize memory bank setup over immediate project implementation
  ensures that all future work is grounded in a clear vision and context. This approach was chosen to prevent loss of
  progress or direction due to memory resets or long breaks between sessions.
- **Technology Selection for PJT1**: Preliminary decisions to use React.js, Node.js/Express, and MongoDB for the
  portfolio project were made based on ease of learning, industry relevance, and cost-effectiveness. These choices will
  be revisited and finalized as development begins.
- No significant pivots or changes in direction have occurred yet, as the project is in its infancy.

This progress document will be updated regularly to reflect the current state of "TELOS about Jeff", tracking
achievements, remaining tasks, and any evolving decisions or issues. It serves as a snapshot of where the project stands
and what needs to be done next.
